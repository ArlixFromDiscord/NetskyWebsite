#More Changes
###The rules are now located on the actual server so people read them.
###The role colours have been updated to be less eye-bleeding, and much better on both the dark and the (bad) light theme.
###NCBOT has a faster response time, has more commands such as /salty, /espi, and /kiss, and is much better.
